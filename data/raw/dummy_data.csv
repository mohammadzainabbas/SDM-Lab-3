Gautam A.,"Self-assessment of Proficiency of Intelligent Systems: Challenges and Opportunities","Full Paper","Workshop",2021,"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 1210 AISC", "Conference","de Moura Oliveira P.B.","Hedengren J.D.","Boaventura-Cunha J.","Drones; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Security of data; Autonomous systems; Causal relationships; Decision mechanism; Dependency graphs; Real-time application; Self assessment; Social robots","Accepted","Autonomous systems, although capable of performing complicated tasks much faster than humans, are brittle due to uncertainties encountered in most real-time applications. People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holder’s goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase “proficient ‹preposition›” using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
